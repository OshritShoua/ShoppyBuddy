IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Several permissions - like the android.permission.INTERNET to allow it to connect to the internet - are required.
- TODO// Despite declaring permissions in manifest file, I needed to manually give the app permissions through the phone's settings! I don't know why this is,
since the only issue I found online with not being given permissions when installing apps throug android studio was when the os was Marshmallow version (and my htc has Nougat).
For now I just gave the permissions manually, and this is not a burning matter, but to fix it we can either check why this happens (might have something to do with the sdk
version) and remedy it, or add code that explicitely requests permissions.
- In the new project from scratch, in the res/values/styles.xml file, this was the original line:
<style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light.DarkActionBar">
and I changed it because the layout gave me a render error
- Because my HTC 10 is "api 24 or higher" as quoted by stackoverflow, I had an exception when attempting to startActivityForResult when clicking to take a photo.
The error was "....fileUriExposedException". The quick yet unrecommended fix I applied was using the StrictMode class, but what should be done is using the FileProvider class,
which I skipped for now.
- In an attempt to improve the layout, I edited the styles.xml to try and get rid of the title bar at the top
- For simplicity (and I hope it actually simplifies) I chose a simple activity for the activity that displays the contents of a given cart instead of a fancy activity 
with a fancy layout like Master/Detail (which also uses RecyclerView that I didn't have the patience to learn to use). If all goes well, we should consider changing to the
Master/Detail activity (or at least just it's layout, if possible) because it's really nice and we can comfortably display details about each item bought...even a photo of it.
- In order to start using dialogs, I imported the "Support Library" version of DialogFragment and the framework version, in order to follow the examples smoothly. However, afterwards I did not find what version of AlertDialog to import in the documentation, so I chose one of them. This is a potential issue.


===================MISCELLANEOUS THINGS TO TRY=========================
- try the Scope app - done, and it didn't work
- read the post on how to use tesseract - done
- this is a more serious tesseract app - https://github.com/rmtheis/android-ocr and using it might be too much - but we can take ideas from it for instance on how
to handle ocr failures ect..
========================================================================

==================CONTINUING STEPS===================================
- continute developing the app. assume you have a string with a price and the current, and attempt to use the converting api - done
- work on NewCartActivity:
    This can primarily be called from the MainActivity or from the MyOrdersActivity. Either way, it should create a new cart for the user with no items in it.
    This new creation needs to create a new object of type Cart (which should have a collection of objects of type Item) and the cart should have a unique identifier
    for saving later on the database.
    The NewCartActivity should begin by displaying nothing (except for maybe a msg saying "Start adding items!"). A " + " or " CameraIcon " button should
    start the photo activity.
=====================================================================



==========IMPROVING THE RECOGNITION==============
-----------------I AM STUPIDDDDDD....TRY THE CORRECT DIRECTORY................---------------------
- read about how to improve recognition quality - larger size, whitelist/blacklist, how to use Tesseract to recognize only digits - try this now as this is relatively short
- try and search a training file for numbers only - including decimals - done - see below link!
- read if including more language trained files can improve decimal recognition
- check what Tesseract I am using! I might be using an old one, but then again it's possible that it's cause im using Tess 2 which is 'a fork' + read this:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/tesseract-ocr/-oeCTcojYfw/tRWUpvc_BQAJ;context-place=forum/tesseract-ocr
- understand where the training file is referenced in the code
- check if the training file is even getting used! This is because my htc has no sd card. see if that code that checks for creation of the directories works.
- try removing the training files all together and see what happens
